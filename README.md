# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9), each image being 28x28 pixels in size.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalizing the images and reshaping the data to include the channel dimension.
- **Model Building:** Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using accuracy, loss, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- **Model Visualization:** Visualizing training history and confusion matrix.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
cd handwritten-digit-recognition
```

### Set Up a Virtual Environment
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
